Alien: Resurrection,"The franchise has lost none of its taste for acid-spewing, flesh-impaling, entrail-dripping gore. But the tone has changed...If this is your cup of slime, this jauntily gruesome installment won't disappoint.",fresh,54,39
Alien: Resurrection,"Weaver obviously knows her role by now, but Winona Ryder is as much of an action hero as Julie Nixon would be, going way out of her element.",rotten,54,39
